            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small" id="first">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently
                takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may
                be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                three to seven, depending on the country when children enter primary education. The children now readily interact with their peers and the educator.[17] These are also known as nursery schools and as kindergarten, except in the US, where
                the term kindergarten refers to the earliest levels of primary education.[19] Kindergarten "provides a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim[s] at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual,
                and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Formal education is usually in school, where a person may learn basic, academic, or trade skills. Small children often attend a nursery or kindergarten but often formal education begins in elementary school and continues with secondary school.
                Post-secondary education (or higher education) is usually at a college or university which may grant an academic degree. Or, students may go to a City college where they learn practical skills. This way learners can become qualified to
                be plumbers, electricians, builders and similar occupations. These course have arrangements for students to get practical experience. Apprenticeship was the older way to do this, Non-formal education includes adult basic education, adult
                literacy education or school equivalency preparation. In nonformal education someone (who is not in school) can learn literacy, other basic skills or job skills. Home education, individualized instruction (such as programmed learning),
                distance learning and computer-assisted instruction are other possibilities.
